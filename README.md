# Random Quote Generator (Fixed)

This is a corrected, self-contained PHP + MySQL project with relative paths
so it works when placed in any webroot subfolder (e.g. XAMPP htdocs).

## Steps to run
1. Copy the folder to your webroot, e.g. `C:/xampp/htdocs/php_quote_generator_fixed`
2. Import `init_db.sql` into phpMyAdmin to create database and tables.
3. Edit `db.php` if your DB credentials differ.
4. Open `http://localhost/php_quote_generator_fixed/` to view the site.
5. Open `http://localhost/php_quote_generator_fixed/admin/login.php` to access admin.
   - If no admin exists, you'll be prompted to create the first admin account.

If anything still doesn't work, tell me the exact error or what you see and I'll patch it.
